# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I am proud that I am able to accomplish these tasks with relative ease and feel like I am retaining these lessons

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
Its a minature program capable of being called at anytime to perform a function or task. At the moment I don't see a real limit which is scary but also really cool to me.
